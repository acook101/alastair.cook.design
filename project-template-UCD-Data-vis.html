                         In recent years Twitter has become one of the most prominent
                        areas of public discourse online. Following the 2016 US
                        presidential election, Twitter, along with other platforms such as
                        Facebook, came under pressure with how they managed the
                        spread of fake news during this election, and what efforts were
                        being made to avoid future political interference from both
                        domestic and foreign entities. While internally, twitter has been
                        utilising both machine learning and automation technologies to
                        stop the spread of disinformation, it has provided a minimal
                        amount of analytical tools for it’s users to decipher such
                        information and accounts.
                        A recent study by the Knight Foundation [1] highlighted the
                        different ways fake news spreads across Twitter. One of the
                        main indicators of bot activity was around repetition of clustered
                        tweets and hashtags on a regular basis, and while this activity
                        can be discovered easily through an extracted dataset, user’s
                        may struggle to identify this behaviour through Twitter's current
                        timeline functionality.</br>


                        </br><i><b>Research, Design and Development</b></i> </br> 
                        Traditional text-based visual representations are commonly used to
                        highlight importance, where the frequency of a word is associated
                        with either it’s font-size or font weight [2,3]. Additional attributes
                        such as colour and algorithmic layout adjustments [2] have been
                        used to further enhance these visualizations, as shown in Figure 1,
                        2, through the reducedation of whitespace, appropriate spacing,
                        and the usage of a contrasting colour palette [6] (Figure 4). Criticism
                        of word clouds have been mostly grounded in the efficiency and
                        accuracy of the processing and extraction of data. Applicational
                        scenarios such as user generated reviews have demonstrated how
                        information can be missed or hidden by the lack of adjectives
                        accompanying nouns within a cloud, and how inconsistent writing
                        styles can increase the amount of effort and time to read
                        information, potentially interfering with user’s overall perception of
                        a given dataset [5]. While not questioning the validity of the
                        criticism, word clouds have seen success in other non-descriptive
                        heavy contexts where information isn’t generated by various users,
                        and is often used within a specific topical area.
                        </br></br>
                        This visualisation was formed from datasets that were made up of
                        three main features: hashtag characters, date/time, and frequency
                        count. The first two visualisations (Figure 1,2) present how a timeline
                        of hashtag usage could be displayed within Twitter's analytics
                        dashboards. With the first dashboard (Figure 1) highlighting a
                        timeline of Donald Trump's hashtag usage since 2016, accompanied
                        with a secondary visualisation (Figure 2) based upon an anonymous
                        twitter bots hashtag usage across the same time period. Initially, the
                        design of the cloud attempted to include all of the hashtags used
                        across multiple years. However, it quickly became apparent that this
                        would lead to information overload and result in a large amount of
                        the dataset being hidden. To ensure that the user would be able to
                        distinguish the different levels of information, I referred to Munzner
                        and Maguire’s [6] discriminability guidelines which led to the
                        refactoring of the design. As a result, the focus of the design now
                        shifted towards a more traditional horizontal time-series consisting
                        of word cloud containers based upon year, most importantly this
                        addressed both domain-task two and three, while also increasing
                        the range of data users could access without being overloaded.
                        While the time-series layout improved the user’s ability to
                        distinguish weighting across time, other concerns around visibility
                        arose. Taking influence from Ben Shneiderman’s Overview First,
                        Zoom and Filter, Details on Demand [7] a secondary toggle view
                        was introduced as shown in Figure 3, with each visualization -
                        embedded within a vertical scrollable view - taking advantage of
                        the full width of the screen. This would ensure users are initially
                        provided with all of the items within the dataset simultaneously, with
                        the secondary ability to draw a more detailed view of the given
                        visualization.
                        </br></br>
                        The D3.js framework was used to create the visualisation, during the development of the word cloud two main objectives were
                        achieved. First, efforts around algorithmic adjustments to the layout and positioning of each word provided the ability to control both
                        the density and space-filling of each visualisation, which directly influenced what kinds of visual encoding where used [6] and
                        avoided common issues around overlapping. Secondarily, both the design and development took a mobile-first approach considering
                        the medium the visualisation would be used within.
                        When considering what kinds of design choices where needed to fulfill domain-task
                        one, interactivity was frequently used across some of the early sketches. Expecting
                        user's to become interested in more abstract data, which they might know little
                        about, additional functionality around exploration and analysis was added. As
                        shown in Figure.6, following the recommended interactivity mechanisms of
                        selecting and linking [9], each word inside the cloud would be a selectable element
                        - applying an alterative contrasted hex value to the rest of the palette [6] - this
                        would then be linked to a side menu that could expand and collapse each tweet
                        that the selected hashtag had be used within. Providing users the ability to both,
                        see the increase or decrease of frequency of usage throughout a timeline and the
                        ability to gain a deeper contextual level of affordance with the drilling down into
                        individual tweets. </br></br>

                        This report consists of two main visualutions.
                        First, a geographical representation of the UK,
                        with England regions contrasted to the
                        foreground. Accompanied with line graphs,
                        representing death count (per day), overlaid
                        across the relative regions. The second
                        visualization focused on regional totals through
                        a combination of contrasting labels presenting
                        case and death counts with an additional bar
                        chart focused solely on death counts, providing
                        a cumulative total to support the first
                        visualization. It's suggested that maps often
                        feel personal to users, and tend to be an
                        intuitive medium across all generations [10].
                        Initial designs focused on extracting datasets
                        based on English local authorities to ensure
                        that the visualution addressed domain task
                        one. However, after multiple iterations of the
                        sketches and prototypes, as shown in Figure 8
                        and 9, the amount of data being shown
                        resulted in the inability to distinguish each data
                        node. To avoid interchannel interference, I
                        evolved the design to reduce the scale of the
                        dataset to regional statistics, as I felt this still
                        addressed the domain tasks focus of providing
                        local data. To improve the discriminability and
                        visual accuracy of each channel, I altered the
                        hue of both the background and the line
                        channel to ensure the contrast provided a
                        magnified view of the data being presented [6].
                        Additional channels were added to support the
                        overall structure of the graph's x and y axis's,
                        improving separability and overlap of each
                        graph [6].
                        Regional labels were also added, as shown in
                        Figure.7, to assist users who may be unfamiliar
                        with the geographical area, while also
                        improving the speed- accuracy trade offs that
                        familiar users may face. Considerations were
                        also made around the different ways users
                        could interact with web-based reports as
                        highlighted in Figure.12. Allowing users to

                            multiple death and case variables. Examples shown in
                            figure 16 show the early ideations around managing
                            multiple conditions within visualisations. The final
                            design as shown in figure.15 settled on a mirrored
                            histogram approach, where the vertical axis shows the

                            projected data would of looked similar, the layout of the
                            mirrored histogram provided a powerful silhouette of
                            the shape of the data. Emphasising multiple levels of
                            information such as; the stage a country was in relation
                            to infections and deaths, how much had cases and
                            deaths increased or decreased over the given time
                            period, and what countries had been successful in
                            managing the outbreaks of infections. Histograms are a
                            common technique to present the distribution of
                            continuous data through non-overlapping slabs, which
                            are usually consistent in size and orientation [9].
                            The visualisation referred to Munzners Separate, Order,
                            and Align: Categorical Regions [6] when refining the
                            later designs. As shown in figure 15, the design reflects
                            the usage of spatial regions between each vertical slab,
                            followed by additions of color hue and a singular key.
                            Embellishments around country flags (figure 15) were
                            used to enhance user retention and their ability to
                            recall information in the long-term [12]. This also is
                            suggested to make the data feel more familiar and
                            personal to the individual user [10].
                            The data was stored as an CSV file which was then
                            imported to D3.js where it was manipulated and
                            structured. The visualisation was then outputted into a
                            web page, formatted through HTML and CSS.

                                This visualization takes form as a
                                geographical representation of the world,
                                showing an animated timeline of every
                                nuclear bomb used around the world. The
                                dataset consisted of four main features; date
                                and time, location, country name, and x/y
                                coordinates.
                                One of the most important aspects of this
                                visualization was ensuring that it made the
                                data feel personal to the individual, as Yau
                                suggest that maps feel personal to people
                                as a result of their familiarity [10]. As the
                                nature of the data was around specific
                                geographic coordinates, it was felt that a
                                bubble design would serve this visualization
                                best as each of the red circles, representing
                                a nuclear explosion, are displayed over a
                                designated geographical region. As bubble
                                charts are widely acknowledged to be an
                                effective way of comparing proportions
                                across geographical regions, compared to
                                other alternatives such as choropleth maps,
                                which can often mislead users perceptions
                                around the proportion of a given value as
                                larger regions appear more emphasised
                                then smaller ones [10].
                                Within a web-based medium this
                                visualization would look something similar to
                                figure 18, once again referring to Yau
                                suggestions on how using multiple maps
                                together can help show patters across time
                                series data.

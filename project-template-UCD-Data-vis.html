                        During my MSc, I created a data visualisation portfolio that exlpored a variety of visualization techniques, that was heavily influenced by the modules (User-Centred Data Visualization) focus on
                        the foundations of visual perception and basic concepts of data representation and analysis.

                        - Has this user's interests and views changed over time ?</br>

                         </br><i><b>Motivation</b></i> </br> 
                         In recent years Twitter has become one of the most prominent
                        areas of public discourse online. Following the 2016 US
                        presidential election, Twitter, along with other platforms such as
                        Facebook, came under pressure with how they managed the
                        spread of fake news during this election, and what efforts were
                        being made to avoid future political interference from both
                        domestic and foreign entities. While internally, twitter has been
                        utilising both machine learning and automation technologies to
                        stop the spread of disinformation, it has provided a minimal
                        amount of analytical tools for it’s users to decipher such
                        information and accounts.
                        A recent study by the Knight Foundation [1] highlighted the
                        different ways fake news spreads across Twitter. One of the
                        main indicators of bot activity was around repetition of clustered
                        tweets and hashtags on a regular basis, and while this activity
                        can be discovered easily through an extracted dataset, user’s
                        may struggle to identify this behaviour through Twitter's current
                        timeline functionality.</br>


                        </br><i><b>Research, Design and Development</b></i> </br> 
                        Traditional text-based visual representations are commonly used to
                        highlight importance, where the frequency of a word is associated
                        with either it’s font-size or font weight [2,3]. Additional attributes
                        such as colour and algorithmic layout adjustments [2] have been
                        used to further enhance these visualizations, as shown in Figure 1,
                        2, through the reducedation of whitespace, appropriate spacing,
                        and the usage of a contrasting colour palette [6] (Figure 4). Criticism
                        of word clouds have been mostly grounded in the efficiency and
                        accuracy of the processing and extraction of data. Applicational
                        scenarios such as user generated reviews have demonstrated how
                        information can be missed or hidden by the lack of adjectives
                        accompanying nouns within a cloud, and how inconsistent writing
                        styles can increase the amount of effort and time to read
                        information, potentially interfering with user’s overall perception of
                        a given dataset [5]. While not questioning the validity of the
                        criticism, word clouds have seen success in other non-descriptive
                        heavy contexts where information isn’t generated by various users,
                        and is often used within a specific topical area.
                        </br></br>
                        This visualisation was formed from datasets that were made up of
                        three main features: hashtag characters, date/time, and frequency
                        count. The first two visualisations (Figure 1,2) present how a timeline
                        of hashtag usage could be displayed within Twitter's analytics
                        dashboards. With the first dashboard (Figure 1) highlighting a
                        timeline of Donald Trump's hashtag usage since 2016, accompanied
                        with a secondary visualisation (Figure 2) based upon an anonymous
                        twitter bots hashtag usage across the same time period. Initially, the
                        design of the cloud attempted to include all of the hashtags used
                        across multiple years. However, it quickly became apparent that this
                        would lead to information overload and result in a large amount of
                        the dataset being hidden. To ensure that the user would be able to
                        distinguish the different levels of information, I referred to Munzner
                        and Maguire’s [6] discriminability guidelines which led to the
                        refactoring of the design. As a result, the focus of the design now
                        shifted towards a more traditional horizontal time-series consisting
                        of word cloud containers based upon year, most importantly this
                        addressed both domain-task two and three, while also increasing
                        the range of data users could access without being overloaded.
                        While the time-series layout improved the user’s ability to
                        distinguish weighting across time, other concerns around visibility
                        arose. Taking influence from Ben Shneiderman’s Overview First,
                        Zoom and Filter, Details on Demand [7] a secondary toggle view
                        was introduced as shown in Figure 3, with each visualization -
                        embedded within a vertical scrollable view - taking advantage of
                        the full width of the screen. This would ensure users are initially
                        provided with all of the items within the dataset simultaneously, with
                        the secondary ability to draw a more detailed view of the given
                        visualization.
                        </br></br>
                        The D3.js framework was used to create the visualisation, during the development of the word cloud two main objectives were
                        achieved. First, efforts around algorithmic adjustments to the layout and positioning of each word provided the ability to control both
                        the density and space-filling of each visualisation, which directly influenced what kinds of visual encoding where used [6] and
                        avoided common issues around overlapping. Secondarily, both the design and development took a mobile-first approach considering
                        the medium the visualisation would be used within.
                        When considering what kinds of design choices where needed to fulfill domain-task
                        one, interactivity was frequently used across some of the early sketches. Expecting
                        user's to become interested in more abstract data, which they might know little
                        about, additional functionality around exploration and analysis was added. As
                        shown in Figure.6, following the recommended interactivity mechanisms of
                        selecting and linking [9], each word inside the cloud would be a selectable element
                        - applying an alterative contrasted hex value to the rest of the palette [6] - this
                        would then be linked to a side menu that could expand and collapse each tweet
                        that the selected hashtag had be used within. Providing users the ability to both,
                        see the increase or decrease of frequency of usage throughout a timeline and the
                        ability to gain a deeper contextual level of affordance with the drilling down into
                        individual tweets. </br></br>

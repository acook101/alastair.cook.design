                    <h3>Aims</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim of this project was to understand the user needs of a newly implemented interactive dashboard in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) within the UCL Hospital. Through the process of conducting two interviews with potential users, I could then critique the existing design and discover design opportunities for improvement. Finally introducing a refined prototype design that would be more useable, useful and attractive to the staff within the ICU through the process of addressing the needs I discovered.

                    <h3>Research </h3>
                    <p> The research consisted of two semi-structured interviews with
                        an Anaesthesia Registrar and a Senior Nurse, including an contextual 
                        inquiry of them both using the existing dashboard, with each session
                        lasting around one hour. My focus during these interviews were clinical
                        targets, however, both interviews covered multiple pain points throughout
                        the rest of the dashboard. During the contextual inquiry of the dashboard
                        I used a think-aloud approach to uncover both interviewees impressions 
                        around the information, layout, and aesthetic. After transcribing both
                        interviews, an in-depth analysis was conducted using thematic analysis
                        across a plotted affinity diagram (Figure 5), extracting common themes.
                        Additionally, I created a workflow analysis based around clinical targets,
                        helping us understand the various patterns that create the users routine, 
                        attaining both positive and negative outcomes around the decisions that could be made. </br>                   
                    
                    </br><b>Decisions & challenges </b></br> </br> 
                        One method that I found helped uncover potential issues and needs, was a think-aloud
                        approach, this helped me gain a deeper insight into the participants thinking and
                        expectations. One of the biggest challenges during this activity was understanding 
                        the complexities of the terminology and tasks understood by health professionals; both 
                        interviewees had a broad and deep knowledge of what their job entitled, along with the 
                        accompanied processes and mechanisms used. 
                    
                </br></br> 
                    <b>Activities</b></br> </br> 
                    <i> Integrate it into my workflow:</i>The first factor that emerged during our analysis,
                        which was emphasised by both participants, was the importance of ensuring that the dashboard
                        integrated into their existing workflows. As one participant expressed their concern,
                        "You run around for 12 hours, like a headless chicken continuously doing work, going to handover meetings etc... 
                        and it’s got to fit into that.". In addition, another participant stated, “The biggest barrier will be trying to
                        integrate the dashboard into my routine”. Additionally, the dangers of interpreting and utilising large amounts
                        of patient-data in a fast paced clinical environment [2] highlighted the need for information to be quickly
                        accessible but informative, as expressed by one participant “You have to make a decision based on a lot of 
                        information, efficiently. Otherwise you lose time or make errors.” 
                    
                </br></br> 
                    <i>Evidence based triggers: </i> The second factor we identified was the need for evidence based indicators that would
                     justify triggering reviews of specific patients, as one participant states "you need a trigger to review it, 
                     not necessarily a graph, just a trigger to say to go and review this patient." and "like an alarm which wants 
                     you to do something about the problem.". Adams and Blandford [3] detail the way information needs change over
                      time via an ‘Information journey’, and how utilised alerts could keep clinicians aware of frequent changes. 
                      In addition to understanding about the need to be informed about ongoing changes, we were also able to identify
                       the kinds of informational needs that should be supported through a triggering mechanism. Stated by one participant,
                        “I’m looking for things that trigger a review: "creep in ventilator adjustment, where people make small changes over
                         a period of time and gradually pushes up and up and you're like hang on, why?". Participants also showed concern 
                         when validating what was shown on the dashboard, "where are you taking metrics from? percentage of flow balance?”,
                          in relation to this, researchers have explored how we can improve the sense making process by considering a person 
                          informational needs, through the ability to edit, compare, and cluster components [4].   
            
                </br></br><b>Strengths and Limitations  </b></br> </br>
                One of the main strengths of the existing prototype was the relevance of content included, as both 
                participants pointed out metrics and analytics that could improve their workflow. However, certain
                 areas of the dashboard included information that they didn’t expect to see, such as the ‘Serious
                  Incident Report’, "I'm not going to the dashboard to read this document", adding, "I'd expect this
                   to be part of an email chain of an email chain or something to say this happened". The kinds of
                    visual affordances that were used across the existing prototype formed mixed responses as certain
                     graphs used green, which one participant stated, “Green to me means good so that's not quite intuitive”. 
                     One of the themes we identified was the need for personalised targets, where the existing prototype seemed
                      to be limited in its ability to accommodate the variety of clinicians that could use it.   
                    </br></br>
                    The prototype was refined around the user needs we identified and the feedback we received around the existing
                     prototype. This included a simplified navigation scheme, based around a trigger mechanism which encouraged; 
                     awareness, responsibility, and reflection. By recreating the existing workflow (Figure 7) we were able to identify 
                     the different users’ needs over the period of a task and understand the design requirements needed. Additional, we 
                     also recognised the importance of reflection and learning, as one participant stated “sit down with your team couple
                      hours before, and go okay look guys, we’ve only done 35% of our targets today, let's set ourselves a new target, let’s
                       go and get that 100 before the end", along with, “The fact you're measuring fast hugs speaks volumes, I can actually 
                       imagine this being used as a reference in our morning fast hugs to help improve on yesterday's mistakes”. As a result, 
                       one of the main strengths of the refined prototype was our expansion of the dashboards workflow, including design solutions
                        that visualised scenarios around failures to maintain targets (Figure 6). Another factor we wanted to build upon from our
                         feedback was providing deeper insights into what metrics are affecting specific patients, rather than limiting the dashboard 
                         to global averages. The refined prototype also enhanced the visual affordances used, as we introduced different types of metric 
                         and trigger-scale badges (Figure 8) which provided users the ability to identify a specific patient’s state at a glance. While
                          bringing awareness to failures that could help avoid future incidents, we recognised that this feature could also have polarising
                           effects. While having the visibility of an individual or teams failures advertised on the dashboard for others to see, possibly 
                           including curious relatives, could have damaging effects on the wellbeing of individuals at work and create emotional distress
                            for visiting relatives.

                    <h3>Opportunities </h3>
                    <p>Given the opportunity to repeat the study, I’d ensure that each participant was given specific tasks when interacting with the dashboard, focusing on both the behavioural aspects of their interaction and, as we did in our study, collect opinions and thoughts around these interactions. I found conducting the interview in the same environment that the dashboard would later be used in was an advantage, as it added an insight into the contextual awareness that should be considered when designing the dashboard. In addition to this, I also felt in reality the dashboard would be a tool that could serve multiple people at once, and through our one-to-one interviews I wasn’t able to observe how these interactions could unfold.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>One of the key insights I found throughout this research was the clinicians concerns and reluctances around integrating new technologies into their current workflow. I felt that involving the clinicians throughout the research and development process, not only helped us understand them, but also reassured some of their concerns. There has been an increased focus towards applying design thinking techniques to public and healthcare services, as Robert et al., (2015) describe the experience based co-design (EBCD) approach, which makes patients and clinicians co-designers of the health service they use.

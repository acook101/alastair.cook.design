                    <p>Creating a design system for a product as large and complex as CezanneHR took a lot of planning and early experimentation to ensure the system accurately reflected the system, while also providing concise and useful information for members of the product team. In the early stages of the design system, we outlined how members of design, development and QA approached new functionality at different stages of a typical sprint, this provided us with a core set of use-cases that helped us form both the structure and content needed. </p>

                    </br>
                    <p>After joining CezanneHR, I quickly became aware of how many design resources were outdated and unused, most significantly an unmaintained pattern library which the majority of the product team either didn’t use or weren’t aware of. Coinciding with the redesign of CezanneHR, I took this opportunity to start fresh - building a design system alongside future designs and implementations of the system. Below I outline some of the steps and techniques we used to establish and maintain this design system.

                    <p><b>How can we promote and encourage the usage of a design system?</b></p>
                    <p> Introduce the design system to new members of the product team when they join. </p>
                    <p>Provide micro and macro information through component variants and guidelines that align with typical product use-cases (e.g. what button should I use, and how should it be positioned within a footer?).</p>
                    <p>Plug-in and play mentally. </p>
                    </br>

                    <p><b>How do we enable change?</b></p>
                    <p>Create a component guideline that outlines a process of updating or adding a component.</p>
                        <p class="indent_left"> - What does adding/updating a component look like?</p>

                    <p><b>How can the design system serve different members of the product team?</b></p>
                    <p>Use the homepage as a dashboard to provide user specific content for different members of the product team (design, development, QA). </p>

                    <p><b>How can the design system support cross platform development?</b></p>

                    <p><b>How should we present and manage existing inconsistencies?</b></p>

                    </br>
                    <p>Following the initial ideations, I narrowed the scope of the designs around their ability to meet the four targets outlined above. Electronic development began alongside early physical prototypes to further establish the validity and feasibility of the proposed solution. Early prototypes were first tested on components alone, which then later were implemented into a scaled down physical carboard version of the design. The programing of the device took a parallel prototyping approach where each components was developed in isolation then later merged together.

                    <h3>Implementation & Refinement</h3>
                    <p>Before assembling the physical structure, the code was tested and refined through multiple scenario based tests. After merging all of the components together, extra work was needed to reactor some of the old code to ensure the prototype still worked alongside the newly added component's. The Pixy Camera had to be trained with specific objects to ensure that it would be able to communicate with the Arduino Uno. The final stage was the physical implementation, which was constructed from cardboard, creating the outline of the 'monsters' appearance and both bin slots.

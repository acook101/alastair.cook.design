                    <p>Creating a design system for a product as large and complex as CezanneHR, involved a significant amount of organisation and planning to ensure the design system accurately reflected the product, while aiming to provide a shared design language and practices across the various teams within CezanneHR. I took responsibility in leading this project from; the organisation and planning, to the internal discussions and company wide promoting, and finally the design and development of a fully working live site. My role in this project had a significant effect upon how cross-team collaboration took place throughout CezanneHR, encouraging standardised methods of work, reducing decision making time, and creating a shared set of principles which future enhancements could build from.</p>

                    <p>After joining CezanneHR, I quickly became aware of the knowledge gaps across design and development, rooting from a variety of outdated and unused resources. Most significantly the existence of an unmaintained pattern library, which the majority of the product teams didn’t use or weren’t aware of, became an early reference point towards a potential design system. Coinciding with the redesign of CezanneHR, I took this opportunity to begin the process of creating a design system, which focused upon updating existing design patterns and integrating new designs, breaking them into atomic elements which would later become the foundations of the final design system. Below I outline some of the steps and techniques which we used to establish and maintain this system.

                    <p><b>Create the UI Inventory for the Design System.</b></p>
                    <p> During the early stages of the redesign, I began creating a UI inventory of both existing and newly added components/styles to ensure new designs followed a systematic and consistent approach throughout the redesign. During the process of modularising the interface, it was crucial to differentiate and define design patterns by the behaviours and actions they elicited. This process took place under two definitions; functional patterns and perceptual patterns, functional patterns focused on UI elements that encouraged or enabled certain behaviours, whereas percutal patterns explored how designs are perceived and the kinds of aesthetically based feelings they produced. Following an inventory exercise, by taking screenshots of the different UI elements throughout the system, and then grouping similar looking elements together we were able to quickly build an inventory that we could work with. Below is an outline of the process of creating this inventory;</p>

                    <p><b>Cross Team Buy-In for the Design System.</b></p>
                    <p> This involved many discussions with various members of the product teams, gaining insights into common frustrations around designing and developing new functionality. This helped when introducing the idea of a shared design language that would both save time on decision making and system wide changes, while also providing a standardised collection of patterns that had been proven to work. Below I outline some of the talking points and suggestions of these discussions; </p>
                    </br>
                    <p><i class="section-list-highlight">How can we promote and encourage the usage of a design system?</i></p>
                    <p> Introduce the design system to new members of the product team when they join. </p>
                    <p>Provide micro and macro information through component variants and guidelines that align with typical product use-cases (e.g. what button should I use, and how should it be positioned within a footer?).</p>
                    <p>Plug-in and play mentally. </p>
                    </br>

                    <p><i class="section-list-highlight">How do we enable change?</i></p>
                    <p>Create a component guideline that outlines a process of updating or adding a component.</p>
                        <p class="indent_left"> - What does adding/updating a component look like?</p>
                        <p class="indent_left"> - Validation of existing components.</p>
                        <p class="indent_left"> - Who’s responsibility should this be? </p>

                    <p>Using comps to approach development with a plug-in and play mentally off the design system; giving room for future enhancements to be made if existing comps don’t fully fit the contextual usage.</p>
                    
                    </br>
                    <p><i class="section-list-highlight">How can the design system serve different members of the product team?</i></p>
                    <p>Use the homepage as a dashboard to provide user specific content for different members of the product team (design, development, QA). </p>

                    </br>
                    <p><i class="section-list-highlight">How can the design system support cross device/platform development?</i></p>
                        <p class="indent_left">- Guidelines should include best practices across different devices and resolutions.</p>
                        <p class="indent_left">- Focus on how we design for different mental models. </p>   
                    </br>

                    <p><i class="section-list-highlight">How should we present and manage existing inconsistencies?</i></p>
                    <p class="indent_left">- Over time, dedicate development time to refactoring outdated and inconsistent front-end code based on the standards we outline in the design system.</p>  
                    </br>

                    <p><b>Establish Rules and Principles for the Design System. </b></p>
                    <p> After establishing the overall structure of the design system, we started outlining some basic principles for the various components and patterns we had collected. Creating a guiding set of principles that provided explanations and references to examples in the system, helped present a coherent and consistent approach towards how we think about design. Additionally, we explored and defined how the design system should be managed and what process should take place when adding or updating content. </p>
                    </br>

                    <p><b>Design and Development of the Design System </b></p>
                    <p> Following the completion of the UI inventory and guidelines,  we began experimenting with different designs, exploring how we could best align the navigation with the inventory structure we had created. This process involved numerous iterations (sketching/prototyping) to gain a feel of the flow between different components and styles, while also testing different use-cases. Before beginning the development of the design system, I decided to research what framework would be most suitable for both the maintainability and alignment with the current systems component approach in Angular. Having prior experience with Vue.Js outside of work, I had an understanding of the fundamentals of Vue’s framework and was aware of it’s lightweight, flexible and design focused approach, in comparison to Anglaurs bloated and complex structuring. </p>

                    <h3>Implementation & Refinement</h3>
                    <p>Before assembling the physical structure, the code was tested and refined through multiple scenario based tests. After merging all of the components together, extra work was needed to reactor some of the old code to ensure the prototype still worked alongside the newly added component's. The Pixy Camera had to be trained with specific objects to ensure that it would be able to communicate with the Arduino Uno. The final stage was the physical implementation, which was constructed from cardboard, creating the outline of the 'monsters' appearance and both bin slots.

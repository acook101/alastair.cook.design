                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>The lack of education and engagement around recycling is an issue that’s shared across all generations, however, the importance of encouraging children to recycle is a challenge that parents and teachers still have to face. The idea of recycling from a child's perspective is often seen as another chore that gets in the way of having fun. There are two factors to consider with this problem, first, children are not typically engaged with the idea and process of recycling, often stemming from the ‘chore like’ association. Secondly, parents will usually take the responsibility of waste, meaning children often disassociate themselves with the idea of recycling, and as a result, when unsupervised, will start forming bad habits around sustainability, most likely making speed-accuracy trade-offs when throwing waste away (similar to adults).

                    <h3>Ideation & Sketching </h3>
                    <p>Initially, I explored a mixture of design ideas through a rapid-sketching session, alongside researching potential materials and technologies that could assist them. Throughout this process I aimed for four targets:</br>                   
                    </br><b>Scope:</b></br> 
                    <i>Define a realistic time-line for each design.</i>
                    
                </br></br> 
                    <b>Does this address the issue:</b></br> 
                    <i>In what ways does the design directly address the problem?</i>
                    
                </br></br> 
                    <b>Feasibility:</b></br> 
                    <i>An evaluation of both the technological and material requirements for each design.</i>
            
                </br></br> <b>Feedback:</b></br> 
                    <i>An iterative loop of feedback and re-designs, taking into account new perspectives and potential risks.</i>

                    <h3>Prototyping & Programming </h3>
                    <p>Following the initial ideations, I narrowed the scope of the designs around their ability to meet the four targets outlined above. Electronic development began alongside early physical prototypes to further establish the validity and feasibility of the proposed solution. Early prototypes were first tested on components alone, which then later were implemented into a scaled down physical carboard version of the design. The programing of the device took a parallel prototyping approach where each components was developed in isolation then later merged together.

                <div class="section-content-container">
                    <h3>Implementation & Refinement</h3>
                    <p>Before assembling the physical structure, the code was tested and refined through multiple scenario based tests. After merging all of the components together, extra work was needed to reactor some of the old code to ensure the prototype still worked alongside the newly added component's. The Pixy Camera had to be trained with specific objects to ensure that it would be able to communicate with the Arduino Uno. The final stage was the physical implementation, which was constructed from cardboard, creating the outline of the 'monsters' appearance and both bin slots.

                    <p>Over two years I led the research and design of a globally relied upon SAAS (CezanneHR), 
                            working closely with the head of R&D, and a multidisciplinary team of developers, project 
                            managers, QA engineers and other areas of the wider company (sales and marketing), to
                            successfully enhance the daily experiences of thousands of users. </br>
                        </br>
                        Crucially, I was responsible for identifying the existing use-cases/flaws within the current 
                        design, ensuring that as a team we were fully aware of the current interactions that user’s 
                        relied upon, while also determining what barriers and usability issues needed to be fixed. 
                        Below I outline some of the significant stages throughout this project.

                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p> The research was divided into two phases, first a generative approach was taken to learn
                            about the existing behaviours and opinions of current users, and secondarily, an evaluative
                            approach was used to analyse how user’s currently used the system, while also validating
                            new designs/prototypes that had surfaced during the latter stages of the project.    
                        </b></br>    </b></br> 
                        Before approaching any users, I conducted some internal research to ensure we collectively understood 
                        the reasoning behind the redesign. The aim of this research was to understand the current assumptions 
                        of user’s internally, and highlight frequently observed/reported issues and frustrations that user’s may
                         have experienced; this included members from engineering, support, marketing and sales.  After establishing
                        an internal knowledge base - conducting multiple semi-structured interviews and persona creation activities
                        - I decided to outline some research goals to go forward with.

                        </b></br> <i><b>Research Goals:</b></i> </br> </br> 
                        - What areas of the system are users focusing on most often (per role).</br></br>
                        - Validate current assumptions and break common myths.</br></br>
                        - How do users interpret our navigation currently (qualitative/quantitative).</br></br>
                        - Discover common themes and interaction patterns through feedback and analytics. </br></br>
                        - Gain insights into how users organise our navigation from their perspective and how difficult the learnability of new designs could be.</br></br>
                        - Conformation of the visual identity and efficiency of the new navigation. </br></br>
                        - Build/update personas from the feedback for future reference. </br></br>
                        - Expand the scope of our research.</br></p>

                            </br><b>Surveys</b></br> 
                                Initial research took form as an online survey, consisting of 10-20 questions (varying on participant responses), covering areas such as: general demographics, occupation/user-role, company background, technological preferences (software & hardware), system usage, opinions and attitudes of the current system and any workarounds/coping strategies. The survey also acted as a recruitment tool for additional research. 
                            </br> 
                            </br><b>Semi-Structured Interviews:</b></br> 
                                Throughout both phases of the research, semi-structured interviews were used to learn and evaluate current and new designs. Interviews were structured into two parts, the first focused on understanding who the user was within their company and how they ultisied the system to their role. Whereas, the second part followed a task analysis, adopting an think-aloud approach to  elicit user’s internal thoughts and frustrations.

                            <b>Focus Groups / Card Sorting:</b></br> 
                                Focus groups were used to discuss broader functional changes to the system, exploring what kinds of functionality different user’s relied upon and how they tailored the system around their needs. These discussions included card sorting exercises that allowed users to group and restructure areas of the system that reflected their usage and priorities.

                                <i><b>Research Findings:</b></i> </br> 
                            During both phases of the research, usability issues and misaligned user goals were identified, relating to both the current design and the various iterations that followed. Most significantly, how users navigate the system was an occurring issue that was reported across all user types (self service, line managers and HR professionals). Following the research methods above, I was able to condense this key issue into four main themes, providing guidance to any future designs.

                            <i>The less users have to think about the interface or design, the more they can focus on accomplishing their goals.</i>

                                </br> - We currently have too many top level navigation nodes, particularly for HR, and even for LM/SS.</br>
                                </br> - This is especially clear when drilling into our floating menu which adds further cognitive load upon the user.</br>
                                </br> <b>- We are asking user’s to make a lot of upfront decisions. </b>

                                </br> - There’s no visual context of a user's location within the system after the floating menu disappears.</br>
                                </br> - We don’t have the concept of a breadcrumb trail that allows users to be aware of their location in the system and backtrack through it.</br>
                                </br> - Users can become disoriented having to navigate through a deeply leveled hierarchy to reach their goal. </br>
                                </br> <b>- By not providing enough visual cues from the navigation, we are making it harder for user’s to coordinate the system.                                    . </b>

                        <i><b>Discoverability:</b></i> </br> 
                        <i>Users rely on navigation first because it’s easier and faster to click on links than to use a search. 
                        </i>

                        <p>
                            </br> - Combining all the navigation nodes together makes it harder for the user to find what they need. </br>
                            </br> - There is no easy way to leap between different aspects of an entity.</br>
                            </br> - Difficulty to find things if you don’t know exactly where it lives in the navigation tree. </br>
                            </br> <b>- Having the majority of features tied into the vertical navigation makes the system less intuitive and frustrating for user’s navigating around a specific area of the system.</b>
                        </p>

                    <p>
                    While relaying these themes back to members of development and management through frequent discussions and presentations, I also outlined suggestions around how future designs could overcome some of the flaws of the current design, as shown in <i>(8. Potential Solutions)</i>
                    </br> 
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                    Further findings emphasised the importance of understanding existing mental models, especially when considering how new designs could alter or disrupt familiar ways of users’ navigating or managing the system. This was particularly significant while observing how new users navigated the system, in comparisons to more experienced (power) users. During the task analysis of the current design, less experienced users would tend to soley rely on the primary navigation - often reporting some of the themes mentioned above. Whereas, power users’ would diversify their searching strategy through a mixture of areas and configurations, such as the dashboard and searches, actively avoiding the primary navigation.

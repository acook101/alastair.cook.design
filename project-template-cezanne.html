                    <p>Over two years I led the research and design of a globally relied upon SAAS (CezanneHR), 
                            working closely with the head of R&D, and a multidisciplinary team of developers, project 
                            managers, QA engineers and other areas of the wider company (sales and marketing), to
                            successfully enhance the daily experiences of thousands of users. </br>
                        </br>
                        Crucially, I was responsible for identifying the existing use-cases/flaws within the current 
                        design, ensuring that as a team we were fully aware of the current interactions that user’s 
                        relied upon, while also determining what barriers and usability issues needed to be fixed. 
                        Below I outline some of the significant stages throughout this project.

                        <p> The research was divided into two phases, first a generative approach was taken to learn
                            about the existing behaviours and opinions of current users, and secondarily, an evaluative
                            approach was used to analyse how user’s currently used the system, while also validating
                            new designs/prototypes that had surfaced during the latter stages of the project.    
                        </b></br>    </b></br> 
                        Before approaching any users, I conducted some internal research to ensure we collectively understood 
                        the reasoning behind the redesign. The aim of this research was to understand the current assumptions 
                        of user’s internally, and highlight frequently observed/reported issues and frustrations that user’s may
                         have experienced; this included members from engineering, support, marketing and sales.  After establishing
                        an internal knowledge base - conducting multiple semi-structured interviews and persona creation activities
                        - I decided to outline some research goals to go forward with.

                        </b></br> <b>Research Goals:</b> </br> </br> 
                        - What areas of the system are users focusing on most often (per role).</br></br>
                        - Validate current assumptions and break common myths.</br></br>
                        - How do users interpret our navigation currently (qualitative/quantitative).</br></br>
                        - Discover common themes and interaction patterns through feedback and analytics. </br></br>
                        - Gain insights into how users organise our navigation from their perspective and how difficult the learnability of new designs could be.</br></br>
                        - Conformation of the visual identity and efficiency of the new navigation. </br></br>
                        - Build/update personas from the feedback for future reference. </br></br>
                        - Expand the scope of our research.</br></p>

                            </br><b>Surveys</b></br> 
                                Initial research took form as an online survey, consisting of 10-20 questions (varying on participant responses), covering areas such as: general demographics, occupation/user-role, company background, technological preferences (software & hardware), system usage, opinions and attitudes of the current system and any workarounds/coping strategies. The survey also acted as a recruitment tool for additional research. 
                            </br> 
                            </br><b>Semi-Structured Interviews:</b></br> 
                                Throughout both phases of the research, semi-structured interviews were used to learn and evaluate current and new designs. Interviews were structured into two parts, the first focused on understanding who the user was within their company and how they ultisied the system to their role. Whereas, the second part followed a task analysis, adopting an think-aloud approach to  elicit user’s internal thoughts and frustrations.

                                Focus groups were used to discuss broader functional changes to the system, exploring what kinds of functionality different user’s relied upon and how they tailored the system around their needs. These discussions included card sorting exercises that allowed users to group and restructure areas of the system that reflected their usage and priorities.

                            During both phases of the research, usability issues and misaligned user goals were identified, relating to both the current design and the various iterations that followed. Most significantly, how users navigate the system was an occurring issue that was reported across all user types (self service, line managers and HR professionals). Following the research methods above, I was able to condense this key issue into four main themes, providing guidance to any future designs.

                            </br> "Difficulty to find things if you don’t know exactly where it lives in the navigation tree." </br>

                    While relaying these themes back to members of development and management through frequent discussions and presentations, I also outlined suggestions around how future designs could overcome some of the flaws of the current design, as shown in <i>(8. Potential Solutions)</i>
                    </br> 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Further findings emphasised the importance of understanding existing mental models, especially when considering how new designs could alter or disrupt familiar ways of users’ navigating or managing the system. This was particularly significant while observing how new users navigated the system, in comparisons to more experienced (power) users. During the task analysis of the current design, less experienced users would tend to soley rely on the primary navigation - often reporting some of the themes mentioned above. Whereas, power users’ would diversify their searching strategy through a mixture of areas and configurations, such as the dashboard and searches, actively avoiding the primary navigation. 
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>During the focus groups (& card sorting) I was also able to identify how priorities changed and evolved throughout each users’ role, emphasising the importance of how a system should reflect the ongoing complexity of needs that a user will have at different stages of a year, month or week. These discussions also emphasised the importance of company/individual personalisation throughout the system, as many participants described how they had expected more control of how the system looks and works - this was also an occurring theme that was identified during the internal research.</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>Aesthetically, user’s described the design as outdated and old fashioned, often comparing the system to newer and more “modern looking” products - this included personal applications such as social networks and communication based apps. Finding commonality with the emerging theme - across all SAAS products - that the divide between user’s expectations of their work and personal digital experiences no longer exists.   
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>In the second phase of research, evaluative feedback helped advance each iteration, using a mixture of semi-structured interviews and A/B testing, adopting a think-aloud approach. Crucially, being able to identify common barriers that led user’s a stray while completing familiar tasks uncovered issues and new design spaces that we hadn’t originally thought of.

                        <p>Based on on the findings above, we narrowed our focus into 4 areas for potential improvement:</p></br>
                        <p>1. Improve navigation</p>
                        <p>2. Improve user configuration</p>
                        <p>3. Improve visual aesthetics</p>
                        <p>4. Improve mobile Responsiveness</p>
                        </br>

                        <p><b> Improve navigation</b></p>
                            <p>One of the most significant changes I made while rethinking how the navigation worked was the shift away from the current sidebar. By flattening out the navigation across view-specific screens meant we could reduce the initial cognitive load that had been reported from users’ experience of the sidebar, while also maintaining an coherent and intuitive path for users’ to navigate the system. Additionally, the introduction of a new “Administration” screen (AS SHOWN IN) for HR professionals, provided a centralised view-based navigation for all their needs (based upon research and feedback), with the supported functionality to pin and unpin navigational items to the sidebar, ensuring the sidebar always reflected their current usage. The introduction of both breadcrumbs and entity based tabs also aimed to improve the contextual awareness of users throughout the whole system, especially when user’s would have to navigate between different aspects of an entity. Alongside structural changes, we also leaned upon visual aids to enhance users’ ability to identify where they were within the system, as modules could now be configured to specific themes that affected navigational elements throughout module specific views. 
                            </p></br>
                            
                        <p><b>Improve user configuration</b></p>
                            <p>A large amount of internal and external feedback emphasised the need for more user control and configuration of the system. While a large amount of this configuration was provided in later releases through newly added dashboards, parts of the user profile and system theming was enhanced. These enhancements included user profiles showing additional information that focused on promoting team communications, while system wide theming enabled companies to fully own the system around their branding.   
                            </p></br>

                        <p><b>Improve visual aesthetics </b></p>
                            <p>As the majority of users’ stated the look and feel of the system was outdated and bloated, I decided it was important that any new design should not build upon existing styles. Instead focusing on an overarching minimalistic design approach that emphasised the need for space and singular prioritisation of key elements across views. Specifically, the reduction of parameters within searches and views, with the introduction of view based expand/collapse controls which allowed users to focus on large data sets, and the outline of material widgets which helped break up large amounts of information. Alongside the redesign process, I also started outlining a future design system, which provided me with a systematic approach towards creating new design patterns that focused upon consistency and efficiency through all of my designs, while also documenting these changes for future designers and developers.   
                            </p></br>

                        <p><b>Improve mobile responsiveness
                        </b></p>
                            <p>During the early stages of the design process, I made it a priority to ensure that the system could be fully responsive on any mobile device. The current design had little to no support for web responsiveness on mobile devices, and as the current app only supported a small amount of the systems functionality, users’ found the possibility of using the browser version on their phone an exciting enhancement. Taking a mobile first approach, involved an evaluation of the different navigational mechanisms that already existed, and how they could naturally respond to different viewports. Following this, the introduction of new design patterns would then have to require the validation of their ability to respond, to ensure the different elements/components that built each design would work in sync while responding to smaller screens sizes. </p></br>

Following this, more mature ideas became Lo/Hi Fidelity wireframes and prototypes, which were shared and tested both internally and externally. After evaluating these designs through multiple A/B tests with users’ and providing feedback to internal members of management, we were able to narrow the design iterations between three similar variations. This allowed the development process to begin and for future research to experiment between smaller aspects of each design.</p></br>

                        Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a serious and poorly understood disease, impacting 50,000 people a year globally. Our research found that people with ALS express a lack of connection with other people with the disease, and that the general public lacks awareness about ALS. We also identified an engagement problem with the currently available resources to connect and support people with ALS. To address these issues, we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt, first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic, then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs, 2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs, and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing, tangible tapestry displays, and interactive waiting education in a unique way.

                        A mixed methods research design was used to probe about social life and connectedness, being
                        understood, and the care communities of people living with ALS in greater London.
                        We conducted five semi-structured interviews with participants with ALS (all male, mean age of
                        60 years, average 10 months since diagnosis), two of these interviews included their spouses. We ran
                        one focus group, comprised of one ALS patient, their spouse, and a Speech and Language Therapist.
                        We also conducted an online survey for which we received 74 responses from Speech Therapy
                        professionals, 96% of whom indicated working with patients with ALS monthly or more frequently,
                        and a mean tenure working with ALS patients of 14.5 years.

                    <p>
                        After establishing the problem space and requirements for our design, we conducted rapid
                        sketching ideation sessions for addressing the two primary insights from our research. We reframed
                        each insight into a “how might we...” statement and brainstormed solutions for each issue. Our
                        design process took a convergence > divergence > convergence trajectory (see Fig. 5 for a process
                        overview). We plotted initial ideas on a 2x2 matrix assessing novelty and extent to which they
                        strengthen community (chosen to ensure our work meets the design brief specification), then
                        narrowed our ideas to those we scored highly for both dimensions. Our rapid ideation sessions had
                        generated some similar ideas, so we grouped them into categories that included crowd-sourcing ALS
                        information, new virtual connections for the ALS community, and location-based 1:1 links for those
                        impacted by ALS. We plotted these ideas on two additional dimensions: impact on our target
                        community, and likelihood of adoption based on user motivations (chosen to ensure our design meets
                        our user requirements). This led us to combine some of the initial idea categories, narrowing the focus
                        of our designs to connecting people impacted by ALS with each other to enable better community
                        support and information sharing.

                        <h3 class="section-title-highlight">PALS('Patching ALS')</h3>
                        <p>
                            After storyboarding how we might use technology to reach this goal, we decided to pursue one
                            design that we felt best addressed our findings (Fig. 6). PALS (‘Patching ALS’) is an interactive
                            crowdsourcing and connection quilt which facilitates connections and information sharing between
                            people directly impacted by ALS, and improves awareness about the disease (Fig. 1).
                            The PALS quilt is hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic waiting room and is comprised of an
                            accessible interactive screen embedded within responsive, light-up fabric.
                            While waiting for their appointment, people with ALS and their spouses can interact with the
                            quilt via eye gaze (in this case utilizing an additional eye-gaze device), voice, or touch. They answer
                            one question about the advice they would give to someone impacted by ALS, can see what others
                            said, then decide if they’d like to connect with someone else who responded similarly.
                            The interaction creates a custom patch which illuminates on the quilt upon answer submission. If the
                            respondent chooses to connect with someone, this triggers an email introducing them to someone
                            else who also opted in. Once the quilt is filled with patches, it can be displayed in a public space as a community-created
                            art piece that helps build ALS awareness. The illuminated patches are interactive – if a patch is
                            pressed, the screen shows an explanation of the ALS advice shared by its owner.
